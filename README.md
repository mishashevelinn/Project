## Current version 
*bug fixes:*

1. Global avail vertex.

2. bug in `connect`(if deg(v) = 3, pull out available)
3. bug in `disconnect()` `sigmentation fault` resolved

*Hill climber:*
1. find how many cycles c, s.t len(c) < g there were if new
random edge (u,v) was added with `count_cycles(u,v)`

2. if there are no short cycles, adding new edge `connect(u,v)`

3. if we found a single cycle,
using the statement:

    **If there is a single path of length less than g - 1, it's the shortest path.**

    we recognize this path as set of edges from which random edge is removed `replaceEdgeOnCycle()`,

    and the edge `(u,v)` is added to `E` with `connect(u,v)`

5. if there are more than one cycle: do nothing
